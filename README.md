## What is Capacitor?

[Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) is a sort of "electron for mobile" that runs standard web apps on iOS, Android, Desktop, and Web. 

Capacitor provides access to Native APIs and a plugin system for building any native functionality your app needs.

Capacitor apps can also run in the browser as a Progressive Web App with the same code.
